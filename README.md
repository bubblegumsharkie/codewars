# Codewars

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

# What this repo is about

Here I commit tasks from codewars to be able to return to my code through time and see how may I make it simpler.
